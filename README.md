The project entitled ‘Giftshop’ is an E-Commerce website where the user can purchase products online.
The user can create his account by registering himself with a unique username and password and then log into the portal site to browse products and purchase them.
Since, modern door-to-door business and manual methods by purchasing products in markets at certain outlets seem to have a drawback, 
the online method of purchasing products are coming into effect and are much affordable.
